    Parameters:
    merge_dict (dictionary): dictionary of dataframes with price data, to merge with other dictionary
    merger_dict (dictionary): dictionary of dataframes with (short) volume data, merge_dict will be merged into this dictionary
    new_col_list (list): list new column names to be added, should follow the naming convention 'description_2digitnumber_first/second', which corresponds to a value to be taken from the merge_dict corresponding to the first of second half hour of a particlar hour and day
    rename_col_dict (dictionary): dictionary stating which columns should be renamed from new_col_list, since new_col_list is restrictive in naming conventions due to necessary logic connecting to timestamps.
    date_string (string): Name of the column in the dataframes inside the two input dictionaries. Note that these should be the same for the merge_dict and merger_dict
    time_string (string): Name of the column in the merger_dict dataframes corresponding to time.
    return_string (string): Name of the column in the merger_dict which contains the values to be added to merger_dict.

    Returns:
    output_dict (dictionary): dictionary containing dataframes with volume value and price or other return data added
